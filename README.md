# Movie Recommendation System

 The goal of a recommendation system is to help users finding desired items faster. Personalized recommendations for movies are offered as ranked lists of movies. In performing this ranking, our recommendation system is trying to predict what the most suitable movies or actors are, based on the userâ€™s previous experiences and ratings. 

 Based on this objective, we are going to build a Movie Recommendation System using MovieLens datasets.  


### Datasets: MovieLens  

The full datasets can be found [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

For Homework2, we used the small dataset of MovieLens which has 100,000 ratings and 3,600 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 600 users. Last updated 9/2018.

### Algorithms:
* Neighborhood-based  Collaborative Filtering: K-NN
* Model-based  Collaborative Filtering: SVD Matrix Factorization


### Major steps:
1. Data preparation and spliting train set and test set
2. Train K-NN and SVD model
3. Provide recommendations
4. Model evaluation: 
                             *Accuracy : MAE, MRSE
